                    <p class="fs-6 fw-medium mb-4">The farm began with a dream planted on just over three acres of land.
                        Starting from scratch, it faced challenges of language, culture, and the uncertainties of beginning
                        something new in a foreign land. With resilience and determination, the first seeds were sown —
                        ampalaya, okra, sitaw, and other Filipino vegetables that carried the familiar flavors of home.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The beginning was not easy. A loan was taken to start the business, and every crop
                        depended on hard work, patience, and faith in the land. Slowly, the farm grew, row by row, season
                        after season. Each harvest became more than just food — it became proof that even small beginnings
                        can flourish.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Today, the farm is a place where Filipino vegetables thrive in Korean soil, bridging
                        two cultures through food and tradition. It stands as a living story of growth, resilience, and the
                        simple truth that with care and dedication, even the smallest seed can grow into something
                        meaningful.</p>

                        <p>Covering just over three acres, the farm is home to a variety of Filipino vegetables such as
                            ampalaya, okra, sitaw, and more. Each crop is carefully tended, grown naturally, and harvested
                            with pride.

                            The farm may be small in size, but it carries a big purpose: to preserve tradition, share
                            flavors across borders, and show that farming is not just about growing food — it’s about
                            planting stories, nurturing dreams, and building community.</p>
